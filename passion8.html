  <h1>Music & Me</h1>
  <h4 class="lead">
    Music has always been a part of my life. As a kid I would sing with my mom and take piano lessons from my grandmother which, I must confess, I am not much better at it than when I was in elementary school. When I was in middle school, I found my uncle's old trumpet and decided I wanted to learn that. I was an average trumpet player in the school band at Carr Lane visual and performing arts middle school while also taking violin class for a year as well. That still was not enough for me apparently, because I had become friends with two young guitar players looking to cover Beatles songs and so I decided to learn the drums. Looking back at my musical career, I probably should have tried to master a specific instrument because I wasn't that great of a drummer either. Maybe I was trying to find the instrument that fit me just right. In 1999 I started playing the bass guitar when we formed The Shampoo Sharks, a ska/pop-punk/goofy band. We recorded 2 albums as <a href="portfolio/tss.html"> The Shampoo Sharks that you can listen to here</a>, until we changed our name to POSTCARD and our style to rock/screamo and recorded <a href="portfolio/postcard.html"> 4 albums that you can listen to here</a>. We broke up 10 years after we formed in 2009. Makes me feel really old to look back at how long ago that was. Now I mainly play around on my acoustic bass. You can see some of my covers and recent original works on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwiKK2SAuo-lSHUpMKeubfA">N8ofBase Youtube channel.</a> Thank you for taking the time to enjoy my art.

  <h1>Massage & Me</h1>
  <h4 class="lead">
    In 2012 I completed the 9 month massage therapy certification from Metro Business College in Jefferson City. The study of anatomy and kinesiology gave me an appreciation and an intuition into how the muscles work. All of the muscles are connected to each other throughout the body and when something goes wrong with one muscle, or bone that the muscle is connected to, it can cause a chain reaction effecting many other muscles and body parts. I see massage and fixing muscles as an art form and getting rid of a knot in a muscle is very similar to releasing a knot in string or rope. To make progress, you need to push and pull from different angles, release this strand before you can gain access to another strand that allows you to release more and so on. If someone strains a muscle in their hamstring, they start walking differently to compensate which makes the muscles in their low back and abs operate in a different way which then goes to the shoulder if left unchecked. I have had many people come to me with back pain that wouldn't release until we fixed the root of the problem in the hamstring or foot. In 2018 I opened a small two room massage studio in south St. Louis called Back Together Family Massage, but had to close it in 2020 because of the pandemic. I still do house call massages to my long time clients, family, and friends, but I think it is time to move on to a different career which brings us to the next passion of gaming.

  <h1>Games & Me</h1>
  <h4 class="lead">
    I was born in 1982 and was lucky enough to have access to a Nintendo shortly after they came out. I was introduced to Final Fantasy, which is a medieval fantasy role playing game, and it opened a whole universe of games and worlds to experience. I also had access to a computer at a young age, playing games off of DOS prompt. I fell in love with the King's Quest series, Civilization, and Warcraft by Blizzard. I spent a majority of my life playing Blizzard games starting with the Warcraft Trilogy, then having my mind blown by Diablo, and again by Diablo 2, and yet again by World of Warcraft which I played right when it came out and stopped only about a year ago because I started to focus all my time on creating my own video game framework that you can check out <a href="icosahedron.html">here</a>. My interest in role playing video games led me to start playing their precursor, Dungeons and Dragons. My wife and I played a campaign with another couple and had a lot of fun. A couple years later I decided to write my own campaign, The Terror on Talus, and played through most of it with a group of friends. You can read through the recaps of those sessions<a href="tot.html">here</a>. I then wanted to find a way to create my dice rolling world in a video game format where the player must make decisions and rely on the roll of a D20. My first game design document is called<a href="icyndoc.html">I Crit You Not that you can read here</a>, and it is a framework that lets the player play through the story of Terror on Talus. After I wrote that, I decided to embrace the D20 even more by creating<a href="icosahedron.html">The Icosahedron, which you can see here</a>. This is my current project that I am working on and almost have a working demo of the battle system, I hope...
