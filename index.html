        <p class="lead">My name is Nate Sloan and with the help of <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a>, an amazing non-profit organization in my great city of St. Louis, I have learned how to bring my ideas to life through JavaScript, HTML, Java, and Bootstrap. Granted I have only scratched the surface, but am astounded at all the information, tools, and frameworks available to learn, and eager to keep peeling back the onion layers of programming to add to my skills. I made this site and my game design sites using JavaScript and Bootstrap. To see my Java, SpringBoot, and MySql work, check out the github for the <a href="https://github.com/LaunchCodeLiftoffProjects/zac-o-group-b">Save Green app</a> I worked on for my LaunchCode LiftOff group project. I have truly discovered a passion for programming and am ready to start a new career as a developer. To learn more about me as a person check out the <a href="#N8">N8 the Human section</a>. To learn about my work history, strengths, and weaknesses, check out the <a href="#work">Work N8 section</a>, and if you want to get really nerdy, check out the <a href="passion8.html">Passion-N8 section</a> that includes my time as a singer/songwriter in a rock band and some exploits as a dungeon master. Thank you so much for your interest.</p>

        <h1>N8 the Human</h1>
        <h4 class="lead">My wife and I are Level A foster parents who are trained in relationship building, communication skills, discipline, de-escalation, behavior management techniques, and management of crisis situations for children with escalated emotional and/or behavioral needs. We first fostered a sibling group of a 7 year old girl and her 4 year old brother in 2016. A year later we also started fostering a 6 year old boy, and a year after that the sibling group moved back with their mother which was sad, and bad, and good all at the same time. We are still fostering the other boy and are happy to say that the process for us to adopt him has begun. All this being laid out to show that my family is very important to me. I became a massage therapist in 2012, opened a massage studio in south St. Louis called Back Together Family Massage in 2018, but had to close that business in March of 2020 because of Covid-19, luckily my wife was able to work from home and I was able to supervise my child's online learning while learning new things myself about this glorious world of programming through Coursera and LaunchCode. Our family enjoys hiking, biking, kayaking, and video games. Our marriage does not follow the "traditional" roles as my wife provides the majority of the income, while I cook, clean, and do laundry. We will not be bound by the shackles of societies gender norms!! I feel like I am a great dad and husband, but it helps when your partners are super awesome as well.</h4>

        <h1>Work N8</h1>
        <h4 class="lead">As stated above, I am an out of work massage therapist looking to start a new career post pandemic in the tech field. I do not have a lot of experience in programming, but as a former small business owner, I know how to work hard to reach goals and come up with creative solutions to unforeseen problems. I am a very fast and self starting learner exhibited by my completion of C# and game design certificates from Coursera, and further by my completion of the first ever LaunchCode 101 independent track that was completely online with no instructor. I have found that my experience and training as a foster parent comes in handy while working with all humans, not just children, and my patience and ability to remain calm in stressful/traumatic situations helps me navigate any work place issues. A weakness that has been revealed to me over my years of owning my own business, is that I try very hard to make everyone happy, which leads to me sacrificing my own worth, creating a struggle to make decisions out of fear of disappointing someone. At least now it is something I can recognize and realize that I am not made to own my own business. I do better facilitating and supporting a team working to accomplish the goals the decision maker has put in place. I truly have a passion for software design and development and am eager to start learning new frameworks to help your team.</h4>
